ParZu changelog

0.21 2013/07/10
  - projective output (option --projective) is now same as normal output wherever possible
    (before, it always used pseudo-projective heads used during parsing, for instance finite verbs instead of full verbs as head for OBJA/OBJD)
  - various grammar improvements (about +0.5 f-score on dev set compared to 0.20)

0.20 2013/04/02
  - retrained statistics for disambiguation module (on Europarl)
    - new extraction process
    - new statistics for some ambiguities (adv vs. pred)
  - improved parse selection for n-best tagging
  - some morphological agreement constraints are now soft constraints
    (configurable through option `relax_agreement` in ParZu_parameters.pl)
  - various grammar improvements
  - remove deprecated index declarations (now slower on SWI-Prolog versions before 5.11.29)

0.19 2013/01/19
  - new output options
    - graphical output
    - output of projective structures
  - support for secondary edges (for control verbs)
  - various improvements to parsing quality (+ 1-2% absoute compared to 0.18)
  - speed optimization (twice as fast as 0.18)
  - no longer depends on NLTK (sentence splitter from NLTK is now included)

0.18 2011/09/09
  - first GPL release
    - support for Morphisto (free software morphology analyzer)
    - no longer includes TüBa-D/Z statistics by default
  - new name: ParZu
  - conll output format now more closely follows standard (old format still available as oldconll)
  - includes sentence splitting and tokenization (former requires NLTK)
  - n-best-tagging mode: CRF++ supports n-best output; parse each hypothesis and then determine final parser output based on tag sequence probability and number of unattached tokens
  - more memory-friendly multiprocessing implementation
  - cleanup, restructuring and documentation
  - minor parser improvements

0.17 2011/02/10
  - improvements to parser
    - modal-like verbs (bleiben, gehen, lernen)
    - minor changes
  - fixed various bugs

0.16 2010/08/31
  - output now retains punctuation marks (configurable options)
  - parser now accepts a configurable POS tag as sentence delimiter (configurable option)
  - fixed various bugs

0.15 2010/04/10
  - changed prolog and conll output formats
     advantages: -more verbose (word position + word form + lemma + PoS tag + gramm. relation + position of gramm. head + # of sentence)
                 -lists all words in order instead of just relations
                 -tighter integration of postprocessing script

    if you need one of the old formats for compatibility reasons, use a command like this:
    python pro3gres.py -o raw | perl postprocessor/output_cleanup_oldoutput.perl | swipl -q -s postprocessor/postprocessing.pl -t start\(prolog\).

  - added multiprocessing support (requires python 2.6 or newer)
  - more parser options (preprocessed parser input as input/output format)
  - Lemmatiser now also recognizes some spelling variations (ß -> ss; Ä -> Ae)
  - various improvements to parser quality (grammar/statistical disambiguation/pruning)


0.14	2009/12/22
  - new output option: 'raw' (without postprocessing)
  - various improvements to grammar (allows rare preposition complements; better handling of some mistagged words)

0.13	2009/12/11
  - statistical information now available unlemmatised (for those working without Gertwol; check config.ini)
  - package now includes evaluation data/script
  - more config options
  - output can now be invoked from the command line (python pro3gres.py --help for more info)
  - fixed bug that would cause the parser to hang up if morphology was switched off in Pro3GresDe_parameters.pl

0.12	2009/11/13
  - initial release
